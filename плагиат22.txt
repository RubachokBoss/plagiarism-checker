The energy derived from the sun's radiation is known as solar power. Technologies such as photovoltaic cells are employed to transform sunlight directly into electrical power. As the sun offers a steady stream of energy, this type of power is viewed as renewable. To decrease dependence on coal and oil, numerous nations invest in large solar installations. A primary advantage of solar energy is the absence of air pollution and carbon emissions when it is generating electricity. A significant drawback is the high upfront expense of the equipment. Nevertheless, solar power is crucial in the worldwide movement to cleaner energy for both residences and industries.
