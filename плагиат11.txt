Solar energy is power taken from the sun's light and heat. It is utilized by using technologies like photovoltaic panels, which change sunlight directly into electricity. This form of power is considered renewable because the sun provides a constant source of energy. Many countries now invest in solar farms to reduce their use of fossil fuels. The main benefit of solar power is that it does not create air pollution or greenhouse gases during operation. However, the initial cost for installation can be high. Despite this, solar energy plays a key role in the global shift towards cleaner energy sources for homes and businesses.
